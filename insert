Stay Organized: It helps you keep track of all your tasks in one place, so you donâ€™t forget anything important.

Set Priorities: You can organize tasks by importance or deadlines, helping you decide what to do first.
Feel Accomplished: Crossing off tasks gives you a sense of achievement and motivates you to keep going.
